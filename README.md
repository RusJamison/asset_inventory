[View the live project here](https://asset-inventory-ff6bf56d6fc8.herokuapp.com/)

The Asset Inventory Management System is a web-based database for medical 
equipment. The database can be tailored to be used by non-technical staff and 
technical staff working in the hospitals.

The Asset Inventory Management System helps to make sure that:
*	assets are maintained, calibrated, inspected and repaired at the right time
*	informed decision during asset procurement, upgrades, asset life cycle up to asset disposal
*	improved performance and utilization are achieved
*	asset logs and asset history are at your fingertip

This platform required strict control over which users could access and add equipment, update equipment repairs, maintenance and event logs in the system. Only the administrator and the users the administrator gave permission can delete the event logs since this detail maybe required in a court of law in the event of fatal incident due to malfunction of the equipment which results in injury or death of patient.

The Sign-Up process requires
* Only verified and approved individuals should be able to access the platform and add, view, update and delete equipment history.
* The approval process should involve manual review and authorization by an admin user.
* User details, including Health Facility name, must be entered and validated during registration.
* The users can only view their Health Facility Equipment list and in position to add and update their equipment only.
